This project is the clone of an already known application to work in practice with some initial concepts of HTML and CSS, it was a project worked on by Rocketseat to introduce fundamentals to newbies in programming where I wanted to insert a little JavaScript to manipulate the DOM tree and review how to dynamically insert elements using a programming language like JS.

## üíª Project

In this simple project to create a simple and intuitive interface like Pinterest I used slightly advanced concepts such as Mobile First, I used CSS BEM conventions, in addition to HTML and CSS, and I also used JavaScript to dynamically add elements within of HTML by creating components, applying classes, effects and images.

Using the benefits of nomenclatures with CSS BEM, I was able to make the code more organized and semantic, easier to maintain and with Mobile First I created a simple structure to scale the application, making it also accessible between other devices such as cell phones, tablets and computers.
